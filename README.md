## Understanding React-Native and Expo
React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that enables the creation of mobile applications using the same principles as React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The key concept behind React Native is the ability to write code in a single language (JavaScript) and deploy it across multiple platforms.

### What is Expo?
Expo is an open-source platform built around React Native that simplifies cross-platform mobile development. It extends React Native’s capabilities by packaging essential features and streamlining the development workflow. Overall it improves productivity and reduces the complexity of app development.

### Why Use Expo?
- It has established itself as a powerful framework for React Native developers, offering a streamlined approach to mobile development that simplifies many of the complex tasks typically associated with native development. 
- Expo streamlines development by removing the complexities of platform-specific code, enabling developers to focus on building great user experiences.
